## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
In summary, I used tableau to visually represent the data gathered by Citibike to show the usage of the bikes being used per hour of the day throughout the weekday, by gender and if itâ€™s a customer or a subscriber in the city of New York. Two additional visualizations that I would preform with given the dataset is to include which months the bikes are being used most throughout the year and which months are popular per gender.
